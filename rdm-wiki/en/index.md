# Donders Institute - Research Data Management

Welcome to the documentation that accompanies the RDM repository of the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour. Important information in this repository can be accessed and modified via a [web interface](https://data.donders.ru.nl). 

Note that both the RDM repository and this documentation are in a pilot stage and hence you might encounter parts that are not fully functional or 100% complete yet. If you wish to contribute to this documentation, please see [https://github.com/Donders-Institute/donders-institute.github.io](here).

During the pilot phase you can contact the [DI-RDM helpdesk](mailto:dirdm.helpdesk@gmail.com) consisting of [Hurng-Chun (Hong) Lee](mailto:h.lee@donders.ru.nl), [Eric Maris](mailto:e.maris@donders.ru.nl) and [Robert Oostenveld](mailto:robert.oostenveld@donders.ru.nl) with all questions that you might have and that are not addressed here. Once the local research administration, ICT and lab support staff has been trained on using the RDM, they should be able to answer most of your questions.
