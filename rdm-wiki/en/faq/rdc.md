# Frequently asked questions about research documentation

## What data should I upload to a RDC?

You should upload the (draft) manuscript, figures and tables, and all data analysis scripts and intermediate results that are required to create those figures and tables.

You do not have to upload the raw data if that is already present in a DAC, although there is no harm in uploading the same data twice. If the raw data was pre-processed (e.g. converted, denoised, slice-time-corrected, defaced, ...) prior to analysis, you should upload the preprocessed data.

If possible, you should also upload the software that was used in the analysis (e.g. MATLAB, Python or other toolboxes).

## Who should be coauthor on the research documentation collections?

All people that share scientific responsibility for the work should be included in the list of managers, contributors and/or viewers. All co-authors of a publication should be capable of verifying the scientific work that is described in the publication, and therefore should be able to access the RDC. External (outside of the RU/UMCN) co-authors should be invited to sign up with their IdP and institutional account if possible, or should be invited to get an account in the DI-RDM system.

## How can external researchers get an account?

External collaborators to the Donders research should use their institutional identity provider (IdP) if possible. Since not all IdPs of all academic institutions that we collaborate with are supported yet, external collaborators can contact the [DI-RDM helpdesk](mailto:dirdm.helpdesk@gmail.com) with the request for an account.
