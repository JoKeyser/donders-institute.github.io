# Frequently asked questions about research documentation

## Which files should I upload to a RDC?

### Documenting the scientific process

The RDC contains files that document the scientific process in which raw data are converted into results (statistical tests, summary measures, figures, tables, etc.). In a common scenario, this conversion from raw data to results is (partially or fully) specified by analysis scripts that can be executed by software packages such as MATLAB, R, Python, SPSS, Bash+FSL, etc. In this scenario, the  obvious way of documenting the scientific process is by providing these analysis scripts. In general, an RDC must contain all the information that a knowledgeable colleague needs to reproduce the results in this publication.

### Sharing preliminary results within the project team

As a part of the scientific process, researchers often share preliminary results (in the form of figures, tables, powerpoint presentations, etc.) to their collaborators. By using the RDC to share these preliminary results, you document the scientific process.

###	The editorial and peer-review process

It is recommended that the complete scientific publication process is documented in the RDC. The following files are part of this process: the files that are initially uploaded to a journalâ€™s manuscript submission system, the reviews, the reply to the reviewers, the proofs, etc.

### Data

When the published results depend on data, the RDC must refer to them. There are two ways to document the data on which the published results depend, and only the second involves uploading files to the RDC:

1.	If the data is represented in the repository as one or more DACs, the RDC must be associated with the corresponding DACs by specifying the DAC identification numbers. Only closed DACs can be associated with the RDC. A single closed DAC may be associated to  multiple RDCs.
2.	If the data is not represented in the repository as one or more closed DACs, the researcher must add the data to the RDC or document the source of the data by means of a persistent identifier. This situation applies, for instance, when the DAC is not yet closed, or when the data were collected at another institute. It also applies when the published results only depend on computer scripts (as in modeling work), in which case these scripts must be added to the RDC.

## Who should have access to the research documentation collections?

**FIXME this should be updated**

All people that share scientific responsibility for the work should be included in the list of managers, contributors and/or viewers. All co-authors of a publication should be capable of verifying the scientific work that is described in the publication, and therefore should be able to access the RDC. External (outside of the RU/UMCN) co-authors should be invited to sign up with their IdP and institutional account if possible, or should be invited to get an account in the DI-RDM system.
