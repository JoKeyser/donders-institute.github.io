# Frequently asked questions

## Whom should I contact with questions?

During the pilot phase you can contact the [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@fcdonders.ru.nl) - consisting of [Hurng-Chun (Hong) Lee](mailto:h.lee@donders.ru.nl), [Eric Maris](mailto:e.maris@donders.ru.nl) and [Robert Oostenveld](mailto:robert.oostenveld@donders.ru.nl) - with all questions that you might have and that are not addressed here. Once the local research administration, ICT and lab support staff has been trained on using the RDM, they should be able to answer most of your questions.

## How can I create a user account?

In the default scenario, the research administrator is not involved in the creation of user accounts, because they are created automatically in a sign-up procedure as described in the [DI-RDM Protocol for Researchers](protocols/researcher.md). However, in some cases it may be necessary for the research administrator to initiate accounts for new users that cannot use the login procedure based on the user's organizational Identity Provider (IdP).

DACs and RDCs can only be accessed if the user has signed up against the RU or RUMCN IdP or a so-called trusted federated authentication infrastructure (SurfConext, EduGain). Not all potential users may have access to one of these identity providers. To help these users, they can be given a so-called E-account in the RUâ€™s Relation Management System (Relatie Beheer Systeem). The collection manager should contact the [helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@fcdonders.ru.nl) for creating such an account.

## How can external researchers get an account?

External collaborators to the Donders research should use their institutional identity provider (IdP) if possible. Since not all IdPs of all academic institutions that we collaborate with are supported yet, external collaborators can contact the [DI-RDM helpdesk](mailto:dirdm.helpdesk@gmail.com) with the request for an account.  

## What are the restrictions on the different accounts?

The role of collection manager can only be assigned to an account that is linked to the RU-IdP *and* that is marked in the RDM system (by the DI research administration) as member of the institute.

**FIXME: are there restrictions on social network accounts?**
