# Frequently asked questions

## Whom should I contact with questions?

During the pilot phase you can contact Hurng Lee, Eric Maris or Robert Oostenveld with all questions that you might have and that are not addressed here. Once the local research administration, ICT and lab support staff has been trained on using the RDM, they should be able to answer most of your questions.
