# Frequently asked questions about data sharing

## Should I always share the data of my publication?

Yes! Our funding agencies, such as NWO and EU, require it either explicitly in the grant on basis of which you carried out the work, or implicitly in their general regulations. The Radboud University has made open access science its policy. The Donders Institute requires it.

There might be reasons why you don't want to share your data immediately, e.g. if you are still working on follow up publications based on the same data. In those cases you should share the data under an **embargo** of a certain time.

There might be reasons why you don't want to share your data with everyone, e.g. if it represents financial value. In those cases you should make a custom **data use agreement** under which the data is to be shared (which might e.g. contain a clause about paying for the data).

There might be reasons related to the privacy of your subjects and where the data cannot be de-identified. In that case you still might be able to share processed results at the **group level** that allow other researchers to validate the claims in your paper.

## Which data should I share?

In principle any data that you are able to share and that is of potential value to other researchers. So not only the final data points that you use in the scatter-plot in your paper, but everything from the raw data onwards.

However, you should only share data that has been de-identified and that cannot be traced back to the individual. The data use agreement for human data prohibits linking the data that you are sharing with other databases, so you should not necessarily worry on other research data that is out there from your subjects. The data that *you* share should not allow individuals to be identified.

## I don't have experimental data, but only simulations

In-silico experiments are as useful as in-vivo experiments and also warrant sharing with other researchers. In this case you should share the software scripts, settings and files that you used in your computer experiments.
