# RDM collection attributes

The RDM collection attributes are implemented as key-value pairs associated with the corresponding iRODS collection.  The table below summarises a list of available attributes.  Meaning of the table columns are:

* __key__: the attribute key
* __value / format__: the value and/or the format of the value
* __multiple__: whether the attribute can have multiple values
* __sys__: whether the attribute value is update/generated by system
* __DAC__: whether the attribute is presented with a Data Acquisition Collection
* __RDC__: whether the attribute is presented with a Research Documentation Collection
* __DSC__: whether the attribute is presented with a Data Sharing Collection
* __snapshot__: whether the attribute is presented with a collection snapshot.  A snapshot refers to either a closed DSC, or a version of DAC/RDC. The flag `Y` indicates the value is given at the time the snapshot is created; while the flag `C` indicates the value is copied over from the original (i.e. the head) collection.
* __RA__: whether the attribute is editable by a research administrator
* __M__: whether the attribute is editable by a collection manager
* __C__: whether the attribute is editable by a collection contributor
