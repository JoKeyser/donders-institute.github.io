# Context Sensitive Help

## Collections

There are three types of collections, for data acquisition (DAC), research documentation (RDC) and for data sharing (DSC).

## Edit collection

Here you can specify the attributes of a collection and who can modify and/or access the collection.

### Abstract

The abstract should provide a short summary of the project. It can be a copy of the abstract of a corresponding manuscript that has been published.

### SfN keywords

The SfN keywords match the classification of presentations at the annual meeting of the [Society for Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/). The specific list currently used in the RDM system is that of the 2013 SfN meeting. Using SfN keywords to describe the content of your collection allows it to be better indexed and found.

### MeSH keywords

MeSH are the *Medical Subject Headings*, i.e. the system of keywords that is being used by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and by [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).  MeSH is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences; it serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Using MeSH keywords to describe the content of your collection allows it to be better indexed and found. The whole structure of MeSH can be browsed [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html).

## Collection closure

A collection is closed in _two_ steps:

1. The status of the collection is changed from _open_ to _tobeclosed_. In the _tobeclosed_ status, the collection has become read-only. In this state, the collection can be inspected by all contributors, allowing them to determine whether it is complete (as specified by the protocol). If this turns out _not_ to be the case, then the manager can change the collection's status back to _open_.
2. The status of the collection is changed from _tobeclosed_ to _closed_. Hereafter, a permanently read-only copy of the collection is created and a persistent identifier is assigned to it. If the collection would be re-opened, this read-only copy would not be modified. The actual creation of this permanently read-only copy is determined by the repository, and this may involve some delay relative to the change of the collection status to _closed_.
