# Context Sensitive Help

## Collections

There are three types of collections, for data acquisition (DAC), research documentation (RDC) and for data sharing (DSC).

## Edit collection

Here you can specify the attributes of a collection and who can modify and/or access the collection.

### Abstract

The abstract should provide a short summary of the project. It can be a copy of the abstract of a corresponding manuscript that has been published.

### SfN keywords

The SfN keywords match the classification of presentations at the annual meeting of the [Society for Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/). The specific list currently used in the RDM system is that of the 2013 SfN meeting. Using SfN keywords to describe the content of your collection allows it to be better indexed and found.

### MeSH keywords

MeSH are the *Medical Subject Headings*, i.e. the system of keywords that is being used by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and by [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).  MeSH is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences; it serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Using MeSH keywords to describe the content of your collection allows it to be better indexed and found. The whole structure of MeSH can be browsed [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html).
