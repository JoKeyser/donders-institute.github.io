# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the Donders Institute (DI) Research Data Management (RDM) repository (in the following, called the _service_) processes and stores data about its users. The DI RDM repository stores, amongst others, human data, and for these human data, there also is a privacy policy. The latter policy is a part of the [Protocol for Researchers](#!protocols/researcher.md). The privacy policy outlined here pertains to the data the repository stores about its _users_. 

Please read this policy carefully before using the service. And in case you will upload data to the repository, you should also read the [Protocol for Researchers](#!protocols/researcher.md). Your access to and use of the service is conditioned on your acceptance of both this Privacy Policy and the Protocol for Researchers. If you disagree with any part of it, then you may not access the service.

The service is provided by the Donders Institute (DI) for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (Kapittelweg 29, 6525 EN Nijmegen, The Netherlands), which belongs to the Radboud University.

The service has the following objectives:
1. Data preservation for reuse within the DI
2. Documentation of the research process to support the reproducibility of published results
3. Data sharing with the scientific community outside the DI

The service processes and stores two types of data about its users: (a) information obtained from the user’s identity provider (IdP) and (b) information pertaining to the user’s interaction with the service.

The following data are obtained from the user’s IdP upon login:
1. The user’s name (given name and surname)
2. The name of the home organization of the user’s IdP
3. The personal identifier assigned to the user by his/her IdP
4. The email address assigned to the user by his/her IdP 

The following data are obtained from the user’s interaction with the service:
1. The user’s roles in the system that allow him/her to access collections, and when changes in these roles were made
2. The modifications that a user makes to a collection’s files and/or attributes
3. The user’s access to a collection’s files and/or attributes

The personal data stored by the service are not accessible to other users of the service, unless this is required for the objectives of the service. The user’s contributions to collections are visible to the managers and other contributors of that collection. The user’s contributions to a data sharing collection as an author are treated as a publication and are publicly visible.

The personal data stored by the service are not shared with other services, unless required for the objectives of the service. 
 
Personal data are stored for as long as is required for the objectives of the service. If collections are deleted, then also the personal data associated with those collections are deleted.

This privacy policy is in agreement with the GÉANT Data Protection Code of Conduct (http://www.geant.net/uri/dataprotection-code-of-conduct/v1, Version 1.0, 14 June 2013) and with the Dutch law on the protection of personal data.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace this Privacy Policy. In case we do so, you will be informed about this on the next occasion you log in to the service.
