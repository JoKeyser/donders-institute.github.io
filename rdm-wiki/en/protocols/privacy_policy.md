## Minutes of a meeting on 28-4-2016 involving Robert & Eric

From a legal perspective, we must distinguish between two types of personal data: 

1. Information that was obtained from the user’s Identity Provider
2. All other personal data. 
 
For the DI RDM Repository, this second category pertains to all identifiable information generated in interaction with the repository. Following the GEANT Data Protection Code of Conduct (https://wiki.surfnet.nl/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=46793534), the first category will be called user attributes.

The following is enforced by the GEANT Data Protection Code of Conduct (GDPCC):

1. In the User Profile pages, the user name (i.e., the one obtained from the IdP) may not be shown.
2. As a part of sign-up, the user must obtain information that is in accordance with the information duty towards the end user (point h in the GDPCC).
3. The DI RDM website must contain a privacy policy document that is in accordance with the information duty towards the home organisation (point i in the GDPCC).

Because the GDPCC does not provide clear guidelines with respect to personal data that are not user attributes, the DI has formulated its own guidelines:

1. Actions that do not result in modification of collections and/or user attributes will not be logged. Examples of this type of information are authentications, search queries, and viewing collections. (To be discussed with the SO, because this rule would prevent us from tracing users in case of a data breach.)
2. Information is not accessible unless this is required for the objectives of the RDM system (i.e., documenting the scientific process and enhancing the reproducibility of its results). 
3. It is not required that all information is accessible to all users. Instead, information must only be accessible to users that need this information to realise the objectives of the RDM system. This implies an authorisation policy w.r.t. the information that is displayed.

For the implementation of these guidelines, we must distinguish between the different types of personal data that will be stored in the RDM repository:

1. The attributes of the iRODS user objects stored in the iCAT catalogue.
2. The attributes of the iRODS collection objects stored in the iCAT catalogue.
3. The dynamic/logging information about actions that pertain to specific collections (i.e., the information that is to be shown on the collection history pages).

The GDPCC guidelines pertain to the first category and the DI guidelines pertain to the second and the third category. 

The current implications of these guidelines are the following:

1. The only actions that will be logged are those that have resulted in a modification of collections and/or user attributes.
2. Information about users that obtained access to a closed DSC by agreeing with a DUA (both static and dynamic/logging information) can only be accessed by that collection’s manager as well as by users that have a OU-level role pertaining to the safeguarding of the repository’s objectives.
3. Communication about a closed DSC that involves other users than those mentioned in 2. requires a platform in which users can remain anonymous (e.g., a DSC-linked blog).
