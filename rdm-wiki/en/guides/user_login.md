# Login to the RDM CMS portal

## Requirement

Before logging-in to the RDM CMS portal, you are required to have a valid user account issued by one of the identity providers (IdP's) supported by SURFConext.  Generally speaking, identity providers from universities and research institutions within Netherlands are well covered by SURFConext. 

A list of SURFConext-supported IdP's can be looked up [here](https://www.surf.nl/over-surf/werkmaatschappijen/surfnet/over-surfnet/aansluiten-op-surfnet/aangesloten-instellingen/index.html). 

## Instruction

As long as you have a valid account issued by a SURFConext trusted identity provider (i.e. SURFConext IdP account), you can follow the instructions below to sign-up/in to the RDM CMS portal.

1. Open the URL (https://data.donders.ru.nl) in your web browser.  You will see the homepage of the CMS portal.

5. Following a successful authentication checked by your home organisation, you are logged in to the CMS portal as a registered RDM user. You will be re-directed back to the RDM CMS portal, and to a so-called `Collections` page. The list of RDM collections displayed on this page depends on your authorisation in the RDM system.
