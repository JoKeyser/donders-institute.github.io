# Retrieve data access account

After user sign-in/up, one can retrieve from the CMS portal a so-called data access account.  The data access account consists of a _username_ and a _tempoaray password_.

With this pair of information, user can access data content of a RDM collection via a data access interface, such as the [WebDav interface](webdav.md).
