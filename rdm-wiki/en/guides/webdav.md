# Accessing collection data using WebDAV client

The data content of a RDM collection consists of files and directories. To access the data content, one uses a HTTP-based file transfer protocol called [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV).

There are existing client tools for the WebDAV protocol.  However, concerning the best compatibility and cross-platform support, we recommend researchers to use the [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io).

## CyberDuck installation

For Windows and MacOSX systems, the CyberDuck installation is graphical and very straight forward.  Simply download the installer from [the software's website](https://cyberduck.io).

For Linux users, CyberDuck is provided as a command-line tools called [duck.sh](https://duck.sh).  The installation instruction can be found [here](https://trac.cyberduck.io/wiki/help/en/howto/cli#Linux).

## Connecting the RDM WebDAV service

Note: This instruction convers only the graphical user interface of CyberDuck. For duck.sh user, please refer to [this general usage](https://trac.cyberduck.io/wiki/help/en/howto/cli#Usage).
