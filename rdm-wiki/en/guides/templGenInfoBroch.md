# Template General Information Brochure

## 1. How to use this template brochure?

This is a template brochure to be used by investigators of the Donders Institute. This template is based on brochures that previously have been approved by an accredited medical-ethical Reviewing Committee (the “Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen”), it is not an approved brochure. Investigators and their centers should use this template to make a brochure that is to be approved by some ethical reviewing committee. The actual information brochure starts from _2. Preamble_.

This is a template for a general information brochure. Besides a general information brochure, there are also method-specific information brochures. For the latter brochures, there are also templates that can also be used as starting documents for making approved method-specific information brochures.

It is not guaranteed that this template will fit all purposes. It is the responsibility of the investigators and their centers to make it fit. For example, it may be that some content of this template does apply to the investigator’s research, or that some essential information is missing. Also, it may be that the wording used in this template is not appropriate for a particular participant group (e.g., children or patients).


## 2. Preamble

This information brochure contains important information when you are considering to participate in a scientific study at the Donders Institute. Please read the following information carefully.

The Donders Institute is a research institute at Radboud University that investigates the human brain, cognition (e.g., perception, decision making, language) and behavior. For our research we ask volunteers to participate in our studies. We make use of different methods to record from the brain and to measure behavior (e.g., MRI, EEG, video- and audio recordings). Whenever your specific study uses any of these methods that requires additional explanation, you will receive a method-specific information brochure. Furthermore, you will receive study-specific information.

The study you are asked to participate only uses measurement techniques that are of negligible risk and minimal burden. The study does not involve the measurements inside body (so-called invasive measurements).

The study results aim to a better understanding of brain, behavior and their relation. However, you will not directly benefit from participation. Disadvantages of your participation are time investment, study-related restrictions prior to participation or possible discomforts during the measurements (e.g., as result of sitting or lying still for some time).  


### 3. Ethics check

Before the start of any research in humans our studies have been reviewed and approved by an independent accredited ethics committee (see http://www.cmoregio-a-n.nl) or by the local Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Social Sciences (ECSS). 

### 4. Incidental findings

In general, researchers the Donders Institute do not examine the measurements with the objective of screening your health or making a clinical diagnosis. Depending on the method used, in rare situations, the measurements may give indications concerning your health. Additional information how we deal with these so-called incidental findings can be found in the method-specific brochure that you received.

### 5. Exclusion criteria

Depending on the conditions of the study concerned it may be that you are not qualified to participate. If applicable, the exclusion criteria are given in the method-specific information brochure and in the study-specific information.

### 6. Informed consent

If you agree to participate, you have to sign an informed consent form in which you confirm that you have been informed satisfactory, that you are willing and able to participate, and that your participation is voluntary. The researcher will also sign the form to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect your well-being and privacy. 

To inform you about the study, at least 24 hours prior to participation, you will receive written information. This will give you time to reflect on the potential benefits, risks and possible discomforts. You will also be given an oral explanation of the research procedures and you will have the opportunity to ask any questions. 

### 7. Right to withdraw

You have the right to withdraw from participation in the study at any time prior or during the study without giving a reason. In addition, you have the right to request for withdrawal of your collected scientific data up to one month after your participation. 

### 8. Privacy

With respect to your privacy, it is important to distinguish between _personal_ and _scientific_ data. Examples of personal data are your name, address, and telephone number. Personal data provide information about an identifiable natural person. Scientific data do not provide this type of information, except in specific studies (e.g., involving audio- and video-recordings, DNA typing) in which the scientific data will be handled according to a special protocol. This special protocol will be described in the method-specific information brochure.

Prior to collecting the scientific data, you are asked to provide some personal data. This may involve demographic (e.g., age, gender, family status) and/or medical information. We will only ask information that is required to determine whether you meet the specific study requirements. These personal data are only available to the research team that performs the study in which you are participating, and will not be shared with other investigators.

All data collected during the study are treated confidentially. The researcher stores all scientific data under a subject code or pseudonym. In all reports about this study, participants will be identified using this code. Only the researchers that collect and process the data know your name. Therefore, they are the only ones who can link the collected scientific data to your personal data. 
 
In all cases, the data will only be used for scientific purposes and will be handled in accordance with the Dutch Data Protection Act (“Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens”).

### 9. Use of your data

The data are processed and analyzed by the researchers involved in the specific study in which you participate. In addition, your scientific data can be shared for scientific purposes with other researchers to confirm the research findings or to address new research questions. 

For some data types, it is technically impossible to process the scientific data such that you can no longer be identified. Our protocol for these data types is described in the relevant method-specific information brochures, and there it is also described whether and how these data are shared.

### 10. Preservation of your data

Your scientific data will be preserved for at least ten years. 

### 11. Follow up

You will always be asked whether you are willing to be approached for participation in future or follow up studies. 

### 12. Insurance

The Donders Institute has a liability insurance for all subjects participating in all of its studies. Depending on the experimental procedures used, additional insurances might apply for you as described in the method-specific information brochure.

### 13. Right for inspection

Besides the members of the research team that collect and process the data in the study, a few other people have the right to inspect the data in order to investigate proper scientific and ethical conduct. This includes the accredited Audit Team, the Ethics Board, the assigned Safety Board, and the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Health.

### 14. Preparation for the study

In general, no special preparation is required before participation. It is important that you are fit, alert and that the night before you did not consume more than a moderate amount of alcohol or any recreational drugs.

Some studies require a more specific preparation, in which case you will be informed about this in the method-specific information brochure or as a part of the researcher’s description of the study’s research question. In all cases, the researcher will answer any question you may have about the study and how you should prepare for it.

### 15. Independent physician or expert

For most of the studies, an independent physician or expert has been assigned. The independent physician or expert is not involved in the study and you may ask him/her any questions related to the study. The contact information of the assigned physician or expert can be found in the method-specific information brochure.

### 16. Compensation for study participation

You may receive a financial compensation for your participation in the study. You are asked to provide your bank account details to receive the payment. If you are enrolled as a student at the Radboud University, you may receive course credits for participation.
