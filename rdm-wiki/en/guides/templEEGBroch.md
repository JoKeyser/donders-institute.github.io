## General

Information processing in the central nervous system occurs, among other things, by electrical activity of the nerve cells. This minimal, continuous electrical activity of the brain, which is produced by the brain itself, can be measured and recorded by using electrodes. The result of such a measurement is called an ElectroEncephaloGram, or EEG for short. Depending on the research goal, the duration of the EEG registration varies from about 30 minutes up to 2,5 hours.
