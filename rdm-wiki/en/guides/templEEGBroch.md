## 1. General

Information processing in the central nervous system occurs, among other things, by electrical activity of the nerve cells. This minimal, continuous electrical activity of the brain, which is produced by the brain itself, can be measured and recorded by using electrodes. The result of such a measurement is called an ElectroEncephaloGram, or EEG for short. Depending on the research goal, the duration of the EEG registration varies from about 30 minutes up to 2,5 hours.

## 2. Clinical relevance

Note: The paragraph below concerning clinical data only holds for EEG experiments at the DCC. For other EEG experiments this paragraph should be removed

Researchers at the DCC do not examine the data from a clinical perspective. Participation in any of the experiments can therefore not be considered as a clinical or screening test. In exceptional circumstances the new data collected may give indications concerning your health conditions. Prior to participation you are required to provide name and address of your home physician. In case of a suspected abnormality which is of clinical relevance you will be informed by your home physician. You cannot participate in EEG research at the DCC if you do not want to be informed or do not have a home physician in the Netherlands
