# Data Sharing

To share data, analysis pipelines and/or software in a "data sharing collection", the collection manager needs to select a Data Use Agreement and needs to close the collection. Only closed collections can be accessed by external users.

The following data use agreements can be selected upon closure:
  - [RU-DI-HD-1.0-draft]  (../agreements/RU-DI-HD-1.0-draft.md)  for collections that include data from human subjects
  - [RU-DI-NH-1.0-draft]  (../agreements/RU-DI-NH-1.0-draft.md)  for collections that do not include data from human subjects
  - [CC-BY-4.0]           (../agreements/CC-BY-4.0.md)
  - [CC-BY-NC-4.0]        (../agreements/CC-BY-NC-4.0.md)
  - [CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0]     (../agreements/CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0.md)
  - [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0]     (../agreements/CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.md)
  - [CC-BY-ND-4.0]        (../agreements/CC-BY-ND-4.0.md)
  - [CC-BY-SA-4.0]        (../agreements/CC-BY-SA-4.0.md)
