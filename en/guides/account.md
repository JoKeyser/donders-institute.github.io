2. Informaton of a valid data-access account (the _username_ and the _one-time password_) is displayed on the overlay page. You may copy the information and use it in the [data-access client](webdav.md).

  Warning: for security you should close the overlay page as soon as you have copied the account information.

3. One can always retrieve again the account information (with a new _one-time password_ if the previous one has been used) by repeating Step 1.
