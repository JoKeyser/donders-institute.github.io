## Collections

There are three types of collections, for data acquisition (DAC), research documentation (RDC) and for data sharing (DSC).

## Roles

### Manager

A _manager_ can add and remove users to the collection, and can change the role of other users. A manager can also add, modify, and delete attributes and files. When a collection is created, the research administrators adds one or more managers to the collection.


## Edit collection

Here you can specify the attributes of a collection and who can modify and/or access the collection.

### Abstract

The abstract should provide a short summary of the project. It can be a copy of the abstract of a corresponding manuscript that has been published.
